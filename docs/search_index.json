To have a more comprehensive view of the peace and conflicts, researchers from the Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University, have collected and organized data of armed conflicts in the past decades (link to their website). This dataset includes the conflict data from 1989 to 2018, which gives us opportunities to further analysis the armed conflicts around the world. (Note that “Conflict” in this project means “armed conflict,” which consists of “incident[s] where armed force was used by an organized actor against another organized actor, or against civilians.” [source] ) First, we would like to look at some general questions regarding world conflict, “what is the most fierce conflict in the past 30 years?” “What is the distribution of fatalities caused by conflicts?” “How many civilians died in those conflicts?”. Furthermore, we want to investigate the conflicts through time and geographic perspectives, “is the changing of the time change our answers to the above questions?” “what region has the most fierce conflicts?” In the following chapters, we will show the information and data, which can give some understandings of the above questions. We hope our analysis in this project will provide you more insights into the broader question of the world’s peace and conflicts.

["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 19.1 from UCDP Dataset (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html#ged_global) is used in our project, this dataset covers “individual events of organized violence (phenomena of lethal violence occurring at a given time and place)” in a world-wide perspective [source]. There are 152,616 records in the dataset, and each record in the dataset is an event of a specific conflict. An event of a conflict is defined as “An incident where armed force was used by an organized actor against another organized actor, or against civilians.” [source]. We simply use the term “conflict” in our project to express the “event of a conflict” or “event” in the original terminology. This dataset contains data of armed conflict events from a world-wide perspective, from 1989 to 2018; includes the time, geographic location, type, casualties, and other information regarding the event of conflict. There are a total of 43 variables in the original dataset, and for the full definitions and explanations of variables, please refer to the dataset’s codebook [source]. However, there are some repeated variables. For example, there are several variables to represent the geo-location of one conflicts, they refer to the same location, but in different formats to suit different geographic databases. In our study, for the location variables, we are only interested in the vanilla latitude and longitude variables. For the propose of analyzing conflicts’ data patterns in this project, we mostly focus on a subset of variables; the following are the variables and their explanations. Explanations are referred from the codebook of the dataset [source]. Variable Explanation id An unique ID identifying an event of the conflict date_start The earliest possible date when the conflict has taken place date_end The last possible date when the conflict has taken place year The year of the conflict happened type_of_violence 1: state-based conflict (involved with a government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations); 2: non-state conflict (between organized armed groups); 3: one-sided violence (against civilians) side_a/side_b The name of the two sides longitude/latitude Best estimated or the actual location of the conflict takes place country Name of the country of the conflict takes place region Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East death_* Best estimate of fatalities for the specific group best Best estimate of fatalities resulting from the conflict high/low The highest/lowest estimation of the total fatalities One point that needs to be noticed of this dataset is “[the] [d]ata for Syria is not included in the current version” (source, p. 3). And as mentioned in the dataset’s codebook, “the data collection for Syria is ongoing but the final product is not releasable at this time with the same level of consistency and clarity as other UCDP GED data.” Thus, the actual total number of conflicts and deaths in recent years should be larger than the records in the dataset.

["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The dataset has a .RData version, which we can directly load using R, therefore, we do not have to worry much about reading the data into R. However, we would like to change the data class of several columns to fit our study better. In the original data, all columns with fully numeric values will be considered as “numeric.” For example, the column year would be considered as numeric, and we don’t need to transform it further. However, the type_of_violence column will also be considered as numeric, in which it should be categorical. Therefore, we change the 1, 2, and 3 values in type_of_violence to categories – “state-based conflict”, “non-state conflict”, and &quot; one-sided violence.&quot; Further, we would like to change the date_start and date_end to the DateTime class. The dataset we chose is very larger, to save the space, we would like to reduce the dataset only with columns we are might be interested in (as described in Chapter 2). The transformed dataset is stored in “data/clean/df_process.RData”. But in certain instances, we may want to use the original dataset (for example, missing value analysis). In our study, we find the most extreme values of this dataset are related to the Rwanda genocide in 1994, which we will have detailed explanations in the following chapters. Sometimes, we need to include these records in our analysis, and sometimes we don’t. Therefore, we decide to have a data frame to record the unique conflict event ID of records related to the Rwanda genocide. Then we can quickly include and filter our these records in our future coding. The data frame is stored as “data/clean/df_rwa.RData”. For other transformations made for analysis and visualization, please refer to our code on GitHub repo. In our project, we would also like to investigate the geographic or spatial pattern of the data via the D3 interactive plot. However, some countries/regions’ names in the D3’s geo-map (list of countries are in “data/raw/global-country.tsv”) are different from what we have in the dataset. For the data used in D3, we need to change the country names to make them identical to those in D3’s geo-map. The following countries/regions have different names. The modified data file is stored as “data/clean/df_d3.csv”. in_dataset in_d3_geo Russia (Soviet Union) Russia Yemen (North Yemen) Yemen Myanmar (Burma) Myanmar Cambodia (Kampuchea) Cambodia Ivory Coast Cote d’Ivoire Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) Zimbabwe Serbia (Yugoslavia) Serbia Macedonia, FYR Macedonia Kingdom of eSwatini (Swaziland) Swaziland Rumania Romania United States of America United States Madagascar (Malagasy) Madagascar DR Congo (Zaire) DR Congo China China, Mainland "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are 152616 rows in the dataset, and the following outputs are the number of rows missing for the specific variable.

If side A is not a state, then gwnoa will be missing. Similarly, gwnob is The Gleditsch and Ward number for Side B. It will be missing if side B is not a state. The reason why gwnob has more missing values is that in one-sided violence, side B will be recorded as “civilians” in this dataset, which is definitely not a state. Meanwhile, there are 152616 rows in the dataset. The number of missing values in gwnob column is 151812. gwnob of most rows are missing. However, for row patterns, we already know that, in each row, if side A is not a state, gwnoa will be missing and if side B is not a state, gwnob will be missing. From the graph, we can see that most rows has at least one missing value, which correspondes to our analysis for column patterns that gwnob of most rows are missing. As mentioned in chapter 2 “Data sources,” we are most interested in certain sets of variables, gwnoa and gwnob are not considered as “very important” in our project. Therefore, we would not worried much about missing gwnoa and gwnob values in the dataset. There are no missing values for the variables we are most interested in, which are described in chapter 2.

["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of the number of deaths based on conflicts 5.2 Relation between conflict and time 5.3 Patterns between geographical location and type of violence", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of the number of deaths based on conflicts As shown in the top-left plot, the dataset is highly skewed and imbalanced. When we focus on the data with death less than 100 people, we can see the data are more concentrated in &lt;20 regions. Most conflicts have less than five deaths. The above Cleveland plot shows top conflicts which caused most deaths (\\(\\geq\\) 5,000), there is a conflict happened in Rwanda caused approximately 300,000 deaths, which is much more than other conflicts. Also, most of the conflicts causing significant fatalities were taken place in Rwanda. id side_a side_b year best 13767 45108 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 300557 47072 34362 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 2000 48183 35731 40030 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 40000 21448 34346 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 1999 30000 35679 39595 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 27500 14095 142243 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 20000 35647 39465 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 16890 20705 34345 Government of Eritrea Government of Ethiopia 1999 15000 1943 33614 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 12000 35674 143468 Government of Rwanda Civilians 1994 11170 After an investigation of those conflicts, we found out most of them are between the Government of Rewanda and civilians, which was related to the Rwanda genocide in 1994. 5.2 Relation between conflict and time As shown in the bar chart, the number of conflicts that occur in each year tends to increase from 1998 to 2018. The number of conflicts is lowest in 1997. The conflict-caused deaths are extremely high in 1994, as shown in the left plot. As mentioned in the previous point, a high number of deaths were probably related to the Rwanda genocide. When we filter out the data related to the Rwanda genocide, we get the plot on the right. The conflict-caused death per year decreased from 1989 until 2005, after 2005, the number tends to increase. Most conflicts are state-based conflict, i.e., the conflict involved with “[a] government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations” [source, pp.28-29], which is higher in number comparing to the other two types of conflict. Before 2018, there are more one-side conflicts (against civilians) than non-state conflicts (between two armed groups). But in 2018, there are more non-state conflicts compare to one-side conflict. If you are interested in the detailed and formal definition of these three types of conflict, please refer to this source, pp. 28-31. We want to check further how many civilians deaths each year, compare to the deaths of non-civilians caused by conflicts. id side_a side_b year deaths_civilians country 1121 24675 AFDL Civilians 1996 3200 DR Congo (Zaire) 971 24212 AFDL Civilians 1996 1589 DR Congo (Zaire) 26 24564 AFDL Civilians 1996 1500 DR Congo (Zaire) 2750 20214 AFDL Civilians 1996 1500 DR Congo (Zaire) 24 24575 AFDL Civilians 1996 1256 DR Congo (Zaire) 988 24366 AFDL Civilians 1996 1000 DR Congo (Zaire) 1095 45053 ULIMO - J Civilians 1996 1000 Liberia 893 24626 AFDL Civilians 1996 887 DR Congo (Zaire) 881 23936 AFDL Civilians 1996 851 DR Congo (Zaire) 908 24489 AFDL Civilians 1996 830 DR Congo (Zaire) From the above plots, the top-left one, we can see that there are large civilians death in conflicts happened in 1994, which potentially because of the Rwanda genocide; after removing the records regarding the Rwanda genocide, the civilian deaths in 1994 was similar with other years. The bottom two plots show the proportion of civilian deaths caused by conflicts, by comparing the left and right plots, we can see that the Rwanda genocide is the reason of leading extreme high proportion of civilian deaths. In most of the years, the percentage of civilian deaths is around 25%, except in the year 1994 and the year 1996. After further checking, the reason for the high proportion of civilian deaths in 1996 is probably due to the First Congo War. 5.3 Patterns between geographical location and type of violence Fristly, we want to briefly see the pattern between region and type of violence. To explore the pattern between region and type of violence, which are both categoical variables, the best way is to create a mosaic plot to see if there exists any patterns betweem them. We create a mosaic plot to show the patterns of types of violence under each different region, which means that, in the plot, region is splited first and then type of violence is splited. From the mosaic plot above, the percentages of one-side violence and non-state conflict are both lower than percentage of state-based conflict. State-based conflict are the most frequent type of violence among all regions, as state-based conflict is the most conventional and common among all types of violence, which is conflict between two legitimate players, namely state actors or the governments of the states. State-based conflict is a very common type of violence around the world. Moreover, compared with Asia, Europe and Middle East, Africa and American have more percentage of non-state conflict. For Africa, there are a lot of private military companies and especially, terrorist organizations, such as Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in Libya, Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabab in Somalia. These military companies and terrorist organizations are senseless and they used extremely brutal method, such as suicide bombing, to hurt innocent civilians in Africa. For Americas, the reason why the percentage of non-state conflict is so high is that, in South America and Mexico, there are so many drug cartels which is the criminal organization with intention of supplying drug trafficking operations. There are always conflicts between different drug cartels. In addition, in the graph, the total area of Africa and total area of Asia are much larger than those of Americas, Europe and Middle East, which shows that the total numbers of conflicts in Africa and Asia are greater. For Africa, as we discussed before, the terrorist organizations and private military companies are the fundational cause of such large number of conflict. However, in Asia, the reason why the number of conflict is so high remains unclear. We need to create a separate bar chart for country in Asia to see what happened. As we can see from the graph above, in Asia, Afghanistan has a extrmemely large number of conflicts happened, and most of these conflicts are state-based conflict. War in Afghanistan is well-known around the world. US government engaged into War in Afghanistan to wipe out Taliban government because the Taliban government refused to hand over terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in the wake of al-Qaeda’s September 11, 2001. In Afghanistan, most conflicts are state-based conflicts, which are conflicts between US and Taliban government. The war had last for eighteen years and obviously, numerous of conflicts happened during 18 years. Now we know that war in Afghanistan from 2001 till now causes relatively high total number of conflicts in Asia. After anaysis of relation between region and type of violence, we want to explore more deeply to countries in different representative countries , just as we analysis the Afghanistan above. We decide to use the best way to explore spatial patterns which is to create a Choropleth plot to see distribution of different type of violence for each country among the world. From the Choropleth map above, we can re-verify our finding before, it is easy to see that the number of yellow color dots which represent the state-based conflict, much more than the number of other two color dots. In other words, the conventional state-based conflict is widely happened around the wolrd compared to other two types of violence. Besides what we find before, we can still see a lot of patterns between countries and type of violence. Because of numerous patterns and large number of conflicts, we will only choose some of them to discuss. Especially, there are a lot of state-based conflicts in Philippines, as we can see from the graph. This is known as Communist rebellion in the Philippines. It is an ongoing conflict between the Government of the Philippines and the communist coalition of the Communist Party of the Philippines(CPP) from 1969 to present. The long-lasting conflict betweem them can be divided into numerous small conflict which are shown in the map. We can use statistical method to see if our finding is true. From the bar chart above, we can confirm that our finding is true that most of state-based conflicts on the map is the Comummist Rebellion started by CPP in the Philippines. Meanwhile, most of conflict Mexico are non-state conflict. Our former finding is that the cause of such a great number of non-state conflicts is about the drug cartel. Therefore, we filter the data and see if it is caused by drug cartels. ## [1] &quot;List of name of side A:&quot; ## [[1]] ## side_a ## 1 Juarez Cartel ## 2 Jalisco Cartel New Generation ## 4 Gulf Cartel ## 5 Los Ardillos ## 6 Los Zetas - Jorge Ivan Hernandez Cantu faction ## 7 Los Zetas - Cártel del Noreste faction ## 10 Los Zetas ## 15 Sinaloa Cartel ## 20 Los Aztecas ## 31 Mara 18 (Guatemala) ## 42 Tijuana Cartel ## 84 Garcia clan ## 88 Hells Angels ## 94 Santiago Xochiltepec ## 362 Beltrán Leyva Cartel ## 948 Gulf Cartel - Ramirez Treviño faction ## 949 Cartel Independiente de Acapulco ## 958 La Familia ## 1334 Guerreros Unidos ## 1438 La Mochomera ## 1443 Autodefensas Unidas de Michoacán ## 1561 Gulf Cartel - Dragones de Sheyla faction ## 1586 Sinaloa Cartel - Los Chavez Matamoros faction ## 1735 Sinaloa Cartel - El Pepillo faction ## 1782 Sinaloa Cartel - Los Memos faction ## 2632 La Union de Tepito ## [1] &quot;List of name of side B:&quot; ## [[1]] ## side_b ## 1 Sinaloa Cartel ## 2 Los Caballeros Templarios ## 4 Los Zetas ## 5 Los Rojos ## 6 Los Zetas - Juan Pedro Salvador Saldivar Farias faction ## 7 Los Zetas - Old School Zetas faction ## 10 Los Zetas - Velazquez Caballero faction ## 12 La Nueva Familia ## 15 Forces of Damaso ## 19 Nueva Plaza Cartel ## 20 La Linea ## 25 Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel ## 31 Mara Salvatrucha (Guatemala) ## 32 Tijuana Cartel ## 42 Tijuana Cartel - El Teo faction ## 84 Pena Rojas clan ## 88 Rock Machine ## 94 Santo Domingo Teojomulco ## 677 Beltrán Leyva Cartel - Valdez Villareal faction ## 948 Gulf Cartel - Villareal faction ## 949 La Barredora ## 978 La Resistencia ## 1411 La Familia ## 1561 Gulf Cartel - Los Fresitas faction ## 1586 Sinaloa Cartel - Los Salgueiro faction ## 1628 Cartel Independiente de Acapulco ## 1735 Sinaloa Cartel - Los 28 faction ## 1782 Sinaloa Cartel - Los Salazar faction ## 2632 Fuerza Anti Unión From the lists of two sides in non-state conflicts in Mexico, we can see that the non-state conflicts are mostly caused by fights between drug cartels. In addition, for Peru in south america, there are a lot of yellow dots which represent state-based conflicts. It represents the internal war in Peru between the Government of Peru and the Communist Party of Peru-Shining Path/Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement(MRTA). The internal war of Peru last for 20 years. Then, we also filter the orginal dataset to see if our finding is true. From the graph above, we can see that side B with highest frequency is Sendero Luminoso, which is the spanish of Shining Path. Judging from this, we can confirm that the high number of state-based conflicts in Peru is caused by internel war in Peru between Government of Peru and Communist Part of Peru-Shining Path. Overall, all around the world, most of regions have a dominating number of state-based conflict, except for some representative regions, such as Mexican and Central Africa. Theses exceptions are caused by special backgrounds, such as prevalence of drug cartels or rise of terrorist orgainzations. "],

We store the data in the github repo, the cleaned up that file and get df_d3.csv using R (as mentioned in the previous chapters). The D3 code is also uploaded to blockbuilder.org; which is also on our project’s GitHub Repo. The total numbers of deaths every year and every country are calculated using D3. Instructions for using the plot: The plot may take a few seconds to initialize. The plot is initialized with a mapping of conflicts in the year of 2018 with no default country specified on the “earth”. Each dot on the map represents a conflict event with at least one death. Users can choose the country of their interests by choosing from the select bar on the top left. After selection, then on the top right part, there will be a text displaying the country name, the year, and the total death that year. If the country has at least one conflict event (the event may have 0 death) during 1989 - 2018, there will be a bar chart showing up in the bottom. Users can drag the “earth” if they want, if they hover the mouse over the land, the country name will be displayed. Users can select the year of interest on the top left part of the plot. If a different year is chosen, the circles will be redrawn, so please be patient. The total number of death is calculated using the “best” column in the dataset, which means the best estimate of the number of death. The dataset does not contain data from Syria. Therefore, conflict data in Syria is currently unavailable. A short demo of the interactive plot: Reference: D3 in Depth: Geographic (https://www.d3indepth.com/geographic/).
